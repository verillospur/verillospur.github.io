				<li>These are notes intended to accompany evidence submission for the review of my Universal Credit claim.</li>
				<li>
					I have been on ESA and then Universal Credit for a number of years, and my addictions and alcoholism, while going in "pits and troughs" - like a sine wave - in terms of the 
					seriousness and/of the lifestyle, overall I believe my condition has worsened considerably over the years, despite continual support from CGL.
				</li>
				<li>
					This, combined with the fact that I've never been reviewed previously AT ALL has led to enormous complacency regarding my responsibilities as regards self-managing my 
					claim.
				</li>
				<li>
					Even if this were not the case, my mental health conditions result in me being extremely disorganised and irresponsible in all areas of my life, albeit unintentionally.
					Therefore the chances of me fulfilling all my responsibilities properly would've beeen very remote anyway.
				</li>
				<li>
					This complacency has essentially resulted in my not being aware of my responsibilities regarding self-managing my claim, as I said.
				</li>
				<li>
					Following the review call, I spent some time reading through the materials that I should have cemented in my brain from the beginning. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><big>I am not tring to excuse myself</big></strong> - I realise ignorance of the rules does not equal immmunity or impunity from the rules - but as a result of this reading, 
					and speaking to Citizens' Advice, I have learnt that I have not done a lot of what I should have in recent months, in particular with regard to informing the DWP about 
					changes in my circumstances. 
				</li>
				<li>
					As I said, while ignorance of the rules does not excuse a lack of following said rules, I do feel that I need to make it clear that 
					<strong>I was at no point deliberately flouting the rules</strong> - it simply did not occur to me that there were rules that needed obeying following certain
					events that affected my finances - and even if I had, my "bottom-line" situation has not actually changed, so although "things happened" as it were, they didn't result
					in any permanent changes to my financial freedom.
				</li>
				<li>
					As I said, I believe I have failed in my duties to report changes in my circumstances to the DWP, and I would like a chance to essentially do this here, now, as the
					information you'll glean from my bank statements may well call for this anyway.
				</li>
				<li>
					I realise it seems very "convenient" that I came to these realisations just as you're reviewing my claim, but it's precisely <em>because</em> you are reviewing my claim
					that I've gone through what's expected of me and come to these realisations.
				</li>
