			<ul>
				<li>These are notes intended to accompany evidence submission for the review of my Universal Credit claim.</li>
				<li>
					I'm very sorry, and I don't wish to cause any extra work or time, or any other problems, 
					but I don't feel I can really submit the requested evidence without giving some explanation - I do not believe the raw data from the bank statements 
					provides anything even approaching a complete picture, and in fact without explanation almost certainly provides a false impression of ny financial habits. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The last few months, which I presume generated an alert for unusual activity on my account and are therefore the reason for this review, 
					do not represent my general lifestyle and spending habits, i.e. my life beyond these few months.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bank statement data alone requires explanation. <strong>This has already been evidenced in my answers to your questions on the call - were it not for the 
					additional information I provided, the reason that money is being regularly paid out as crypto would be completely unknown.</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: center"><strong><big><big>I therefore implore you to read this explanation alongside the requested bank statement evidence.</big></big></strong></p>
			<p style="padding: 10px; border: 1px dashed; text-align: center">
				<strong><big>
					I realise I can't force anybody to read anything --
					<br />but the statements alone give an entirely wrong impression, 
					<br />and these notes provide the
					necessary context.
				</big></strong>
			</p>
			<p style="display: none;">
				I realise now that I should have notified the DWP about changes to my situation.
			</p>
			<p style="display: none;">
				I've attempted to bullet-point the information, rather than expect you to read through reams of text.

						All the money in my Reward Saver account ** DOES NOT BELONG TO ME **

				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<big><strong>
						I inherited &pound;20,000, which I should have reported to you, but it didn't occur to me to do so because
						<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a) I immediately gave the money in full to my brother, so my financial situation didn't actually change; and
						<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b) because I am irresponsible and disorganised and was ignorant of the rules.
					</strong></big>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li style="text-align: center; list-style: none;">
					<big><big>Please read on for a full of explanation and elaboration of this.</big></big>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>I imagine the unusual activity on my current account is due to the larger amounts of money than usual being transferred in and spent.</li>
				<li>This is due to an inheritence I received earlier this year from a deceased grandparent</li>
				<li>The amount was &pound;20,000</li>
				<li>This would be great for most people I'm sure but for me it didn't make any difference to my life, at least not in the short-term...</li>
				<li>As soon as I received the money, I contacted my brother and gave the money in full to him.</li>
				
				
				<li>I realise now that I should have reported this to you, but as I previously explained it simply didn't occur to me to do so.</li>
				<li>I owe my brother tens of thousands of pounds, so in order to make a dent (so to speak) in this debt, I gave the entire &pound;20K to my brother.</li>
				<li>I was about to send the money to my brother but he suggested I just send him &pound;10,000 instead, and use the other &pound;10k to put a dent in 
				the debt to my drug dealers, and to make them back off for a few months.</li>
				<li>I initially agreed, but subsequently it occurred to me that if the dealers had reason to believe I had acquired a significant sum of money, they may actually
					<strong>step up</strong> the terrorisation and start regularly demanding larger amounts of money, rather than backing off.
				</li>
				<li>This is when I decided I have to move house, and I decided to "keep" the &pound;10k in my savings account, in order to create a false impression of my
					financial situation for any estate agents.</li>
				<li>(I am a terrible prospect on paper, so my idea was/is to use statements for the savings account to create this false impression.)</li>
				<li>My brother agreed to allow me to "hang on" to the &pound;10k until I'd acquired somewhere else to live.</li>
				<li>
					This didn't go as planned though, because I'm a stupid drug addict, and I started spending the money on drugs - as you can see from the statements.
					However I have since stopped doing this and vowed to not spend any more. This is a BIG PROBLEM for me though, 
					because my brother is expecting all the money back again, and I'm very worried about the problems it's going to cause with
					my brother and the support I have from him. I essentially need to put &pound;6,000 back into the savings account before I send it 
					back to him. I've no idea how I'm going to do this, especially given the decisions I'm predicting this review will result in being made!
				</li>
				<li>
					Anyway - I subsequently convinced my brother to send BACK the &pound;10k I had sent to him, because the additional money makes my case stronger with the 
					estate agents. 
					<br />He agreed and sent it back to me, and is happy to let me hold on to it for these purposes and is expecting &pound;20k back from me once I've acquired 
					a new place to live.
