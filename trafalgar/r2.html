			<ul>
				<li>These are notes intended to accompany evidence submission for the review of my Universal Credit claim.</li>
				<li>
					I'm very sorry, and I don't wish to cause any extra work or time, or any other problems, 
					but I don't feel I can really submit the requested evidence without giving some explanation - I do not believe the raw data from the bank statements 
					provides anything even approaching a complete picture, and in fact without explanation almost certainly provides a false impression of ny financial habits. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The last few months, which I presume generated an alert for unusual activity on my account and are therefore the reason for this review, 
					do not represent my general lifestyle and spending habits, i.e. my life beyond these few months.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bank statement data alone requires explanation. <strong>This has already been evidenced in my answers to your questions on the call - were it not for the 
					additional information I provided, the reason that money is being regularly paid out as crypto would be completely unknown.</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>I therefore implore you to read this explanation alongside the requested bank statement evidence.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I realise I can't force anybody to read anything, but the statements alone give an entirely wrong impression, and these notes provide the
					necessary context.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="display: none;">
				I realise now that I should have notified the DWP about changes to my situation.
			</p>
			<p style="display: none;">
				I've attempted to bullet-point the information, rather than expect you to read through reams of text.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have my undying gratitude and respect for continuing to read this.</li>
				<li>This assumes you have my answers to the questions from the telephone call.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					I inherited &pound;20k, which I should have reported to you, but it didn't occur to do so because
					<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a) I immediately gave the entirety to my brother, so my financial situation didn't actually change; and
					<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b) because I am irresponsible and disorganised and was ignorant of the rules.
				</li>
				<li>
					All the money in my Reward Saver account DOES NOT BELONG TO ME, and is simply "parked" there so I can deceive an estate agent 
					into letting me rent a property. Once this is done, that money is to be sent in its entirety to my brother.</li>
				</li>
				<li>Please read on for a full of explanation and elaboration of this.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr />
			<ul>
				<li>I imagine the unusual activity on my current account is due to the larger amounts of money than usual being transferred in and spent.</li>
				<li>This is due to an inheritence I received earlier this year from a deceased grandparent</li>
				<li>The amount was &pound;20,000</li>
				<li>As soon as I received the money, I contacted my brother and gave the money in it's entirety to him.</li>
				
				<li>This would be great for most people I'm sure but for me it didn't make any difference to my life, at least not in the short-term...</li>

				A few months ago, earlier this year, I received some inheritence money - &pound;20,000. This would be great for most people I'm sure but for me it didn't make any
				difference to my life, at least not in the short-term. I owe my brother tens of thousands of pounds, so in order to make a dent (so to speak) in this debt, 
				I gave the entire &pound;20K to my brother. I was about to send the money to my brother but he suggested I just send him &pound;10,000 instead, and use the other &pound;10k 
				to put a dent in the debt to my drug dealers, and to make them back off for a few months.
				<br /><br />
				I initially agreed, but subsequently it occurred to me that if the dealers had reason to believe I had acquired a significant sum of money, they may actually
				<strong>step up</strong> the terrorisation and start regularly demanding larger amounts of money, rather than backing off as intended.
				<br /><br />
				This is when I decided I have to move house, and I decided to "keep" the &pound;10k in my savings account, in order to fool the estate agents. I didn't tell my brother 
				that I hadn't paid the &pound;10K to the drug dealers, as far as he's aware, that money 
				<br /><br />
				I'm a terrible prospect on paper and so the idea was/is to make it appear that I live from savings or a trust fund or something, and just transfer money in as needed.
				<br /><br />
				This didn't go as planned though, because I'm a massive drug addict, and I started spending the money on drugs. However I have since stopped doing this and vowed to not spend
				any more. This is a BIG PROBLEM for me though, because my brother is expecting all the money back again, and I'm very worried about the problems it's going to cause with
				my brother and the support I have from him. 
				<br /><br />
				In any case, I can't do much about that right now, but will do my best to put back the money I've since spent (about &pound;3k).
				<br /><br />
				I subsequently convinced my brother to send BACK the &pound;10k I had sent to him, because the additional money makes my case stronger with the estate agents. He is happy to 
				let me hold on to it for these purposes and is expecting &pound;20k back from me once I've acquired a new place to live.
