				<li>These are notes intended to accompany evidence submission for the review of my Universal Credit claim.</li>
				<hr />
				I'm very sorry, and I don't wish to cause any extra work or time, or any other problems, 
				but I don't feel I can really submit the requested evidence without giving some explanation - I do not believe the raw data from the bank statements 
				provides anything even approaching a complete picture, and in fact without explanation almost certainly provides a false impression of ny financial habits. 
				<hr />
				<li>The last few months, which I presume generated an alert for unusual activity on the accounts and are therefore the reason for this review, 
				do not represent my general lifestyle and spending habits.</li>
				<li>The bank statement data alone requires explanation - this has already been evidenced in my answers to your questions on the call - were it not for the additional 
				information I provided, the reason that money is being regularly paid out as crypto would be completely and totally unavailable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>I therefore implore you to read this explanation alongside the requested bank statement evidence.</strong>
				<br />
				I realise I can't force anybody to read anything, but the statements alone give an entirely wrong impression, and these notes provide the
				necessary context. <em>(Which I suppose would probably be provided anyway when you ask about the information here...)</em>
			</p>
			<p style="display: none;">
				I realise now that I should have notified the DWP about changes to my situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've attempted to bullet-point the information, rather than expect you to read through reams of text.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li></li>
			</ul>

				A few months ago, earlier this year, I received some inheritence money - &pound;20,000. This would be great for most people I'm sure but for me it didn't make any
				difference to my life, at least not in the short-term. I owe my brother tens of thousands of pounds, so in order to make a dent (so to speak) in this debt, 
				I gave the entire &pound;20K to my brother. I was about to send the money to my brother but he suggested I just send him &pound;10,000 instead, and use the other &pound;10k 
				to put a dent in the debt to my drug dealers, and to make them back off for a few months.
