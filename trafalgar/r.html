			<p>Hope you don't mind, all the plotting on WhatsApp was starting to make me a bit uncomfortable. Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not after me!</p>
			<p>
				Ok, so basically I didn't offer any information beyond what was asked of me during the phone call - so they currently only know about the &pound;10k, not the &pound;20k. 
				<br />
				But they've asked for statements for my savings account now, so they're gonna see the &pound;20k.
				<br /><br />
				I'm gonna write out pretty much everthing I plan to tell them, but you don't need to read it all if you don't want to - I think you've pretty much heard
				this before anyway, but I'm not 100% on how much etc and don't want to say anything involving you without you being aware.
				<br /><br />
				OK - so, in summary: 
				<br /><br />
				I'm going to say that I received the &pound;20k inheritence, and as I owe you tens of thousands of pounds (I will refuse to say how much) the money become
				yours as soon as I received it. I was going to send the whole lot to you to reduce my debt to you, but you suggested that instead I just send half, and use
				the other &pound;10k to put a major dent in the money owed to my drug dealer pals, and to get them to back off for a bit.
				<br /><br />
				I initially agreed, but subsequently it occurred to me that if the dealers had reason to believe I had acquired a significant sum of money, they may actually
				<string>step up</string> the terroisation rather than backing off as intended.
				<br /><br />
				This is when I decided I have to move house, and I decided to "keep" the &pound;10k in my savings account, in order to fool the estate agents, as we've discussed, right?
				I'm a terrible prospect on paper and so the idea was/is to make it appear that I live from savings or a trust fund or something, and just transfer money in as needed.
				<br /><br />
				This didn't go as planned though, because I'm a msasive drug addict, and I started spending the money on drugs. However I have since stopped doing this and vowed to not spend
				any more. This is a BIG PROBLEM for me though, because my brother is expecting all the money back again, and I'm very worried about the problems it's going to cause with
				my brother and the support I have from him. 
				<br /><br />
				In any case, I can't do much about that right now, but will do my best to put back the money I've since spent (about &pound;3k).
				<br /><br />
				I subsequently convinced my brother to send BACK the &pound;10k I had sent to him, because the additional money makes my case stronger with the estate agents. He is happy to 
				let me hold on to it for these purposes and is expecting &pound;20k back from me once I've acquired a new place to live.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>OK - that's your involvement.</strong> Let me know if there's any issue/problems there.
				<br /><br />
				From here on is optional reading so only if you've got the time etc. Either way, thanks for having a look!
				<br /><br /><br />
				Right, so. After the phone call, I offered to send along additional "explaining" material - I think I told you - but they've refused, and said they'll let me know if they
				require anything additional. 
				<br /><br />
				I'm going to insist, saying this:
				<br /><br />
				I'm very sorry, and I don't wish to cause any problems, but I do not feel I can submit the requested evidence without submitting some contextual information with it.
				<br /><br />
				The reason for this is that I do not believe the raw data from the bank statements provides anything even approaching a complete picture. This has already been
				evidenced in my answers to your questions on the call - were it not for the additional information I provided, the reason for so much money beinge paid out as crypto would be 
				completely and totally unavailable. <em>(Rob - this is referring to the &pound;650 p.m. from you that bascailly all goes to crypto, and they can't verify anything beyond
				that point, not without a quantum computer, lol).</em>
				<br /><br />
				While I can't force anybody to read the documentation I send, I will feeel far more comfortable knowing that I have tried to explain as best I couldm, and that the
				contentual information and explanations are in the permanent record, such as it is.
				<br /><br />
				<em>(Rob - the above will be the message in my "journal" - used to exchange textual messages between me and the DWP, basically. What follows will essentially comprise
				the content of the actual written document I send alongside the savings bank statements.)
				<br /><br />
